# Conditional values
Conditional values simplify conditional logic and get rid of **if**-statements in the code.

Conditional values is a Decision Table implementation.

Decision Table represents a set of conditions and corresponding actions for these conditions.
This Decision Table is created during a design time.

During a runtime Decision Table is used to find best matching conditions based on the current context.
So during a runtime a context and created and lookup is performed for this context.
The result of lookup is used to perform actions, corresponding to the triggered conditions.
